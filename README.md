# Component Tree Webpack Plugin

Generates a JSON file with a tree representation of all the module dependencies within a specified list of directories that match certain extensions. It's particularly useful to generate a hierarchy of React components.

## Installation

```shell
npm install component-tree-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

## Usage

In your webpack configuration file:

1. Require the plugin

   ```js
   const ComponentTreePlugin = require('component-tree-webpack-plugin');
   ```
   
1. Add the plugin to the `plugins` array:

   ```js
   plugins: ([
     new ComponentTreePlugin({
       directories: [
         path.resolve(__dirname, 'frontend/components/'),
         path.resolve(__dirname, 'frontend/containers/'),
         path.resolve(__dirname, 'frontend/views/')
       ],
       extensions: ['.jsx'],
       outputPath: '/../component-map.json'
     })
   ])
   ```
   
## Options

- `directories` (Array): A list of directories to look for components in
- `extensions` (Array): A list of allowed extensions for components (default: `['.jsx']`)
- `outputPath` (String): The full path to the generated JSON file
